This module implements the AWS config configuration
described in [this AWS blog document](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/mt/how-to-deploy-aws-config-conformance-packs-using-terraform/).

I also added some features, like :

- a variable holding the list of conformance packs to activate
(the list of available packs is [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-rules/tree/master/aws-config-conformance-packs))
